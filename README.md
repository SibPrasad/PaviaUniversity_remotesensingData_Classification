# PaviaUniversity_remotesensingData_Classification
Deep comparision based classification model to classify remote sensing data taken for Pavia University

Create A bench mark model after applying all possible machine learning algorithm and hyperparameter tuning and then comapre performance with MLP(one layered), ANN, CNN.
and As expected CNN performed well and return mora accuracy ie; 96% on testing data.
